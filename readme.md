Fiction metadata
================

This repository gives NovelTM a place to coordinate our work on metadata for English-language fiction. Right now it contains mainly two large datasets that include all volumes recognized as "fiction" by an algorithmic sweep through HathiTrust. The nature of the creation process means that these lists incorporate a certain amount of error.

Over the next few months, shorter and more selective lists of fiction will be added. Eventually this whole repo may be frozen in a citable, stable form using Zenodo or (more likely) the NovelTM Dataverse. Right now, the constituent parts (described below) are mostly already available in a stable, citable form.
