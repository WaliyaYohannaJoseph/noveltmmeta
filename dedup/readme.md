deduplication
=============

Code used in the deduplication process. Mainly Jupyter notebooks for legibility.

**first_deduplication.ipynb** takes the dataset from masterficmeta.tsv to manifestationmeta.tsv, which has one physical copy of each volume. It also does some standarization of author names, and in the process produces **authorgroups.tsv**, recording names taken to be "the same person."
