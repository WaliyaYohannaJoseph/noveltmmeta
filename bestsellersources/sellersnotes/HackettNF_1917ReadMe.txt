Column Ids:  Hackettlist notes the year list used; NumInList merely records the number from the top 10.  Not clear from information provided how the rank is sorted.  According to Hackett, the 1895-1912 lists are lists from The Bookman.

Other notes:
*Hackett only provides 1-7 for this year.  Instead of "nonfiction" the list is entitled "General Nonfiction" because Hackett brackets out "War Books" for a separate top-10 for the years 1917 and 1918.  It is important to note that in keeping with the trend from earlier years, poetry and drama crop up in the list labeled "Nonfiction."  I am offsetting this oversight with the "Jgenre" column.

*"Nonfiction and war books (both added classifications in this year) showed what the war-minded American public wanted, for most books on this 'general nonfiction' list reflected the emotions and emergencies of wartime America" (Hackett 84).

*"Over the Top, best-remembered of World War I accounts, glorified the doughboy and sold 350,000 copies in 1917" (Hackett 84).
