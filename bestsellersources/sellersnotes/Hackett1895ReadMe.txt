HACKETT 1895 List

*Anomaly:  1895 list odd inclusion of Nordau's Degeneration under fiction.  In Hackett, she mislabels it "Regeneration" (see Hackett 59).  

Column Ids:  Hackettlist notes the year list used; NumInList merely records the number from the top 10.  Not clear from information provided how the rank is sorted.  According to Hackett, the 1895-1912 lists are lists from The Bookman.

Yellow highlighter: indicates publisher that corresponds with one cited in Hackett.
