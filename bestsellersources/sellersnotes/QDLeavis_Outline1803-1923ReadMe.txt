Overview:

This list represents Q.D. Leavis’ Outline of Popular Fiction from Fiction and the Reading Public.  Her list runs from 1578-1930 and covers “popular” works of fiction.  For the purposes of this project, only the 1803-1923 portion of Leavis’ list is reproduced. Titles present both in Leavis’ list and HathiTrust’s holdings were selected for inclusion.

In her prefatory remark to the list, Leavis explains her selection rationale:
“No attempt is made here to record all popular successes or even all popular novelists.  Each novel is chosen as representative of the popular fiction of its time, and if a gap in years is left it may be assumed that the same kind of fiction was being read in the interval. In general, the first successful novel only of a steady bestseller is recorded” (331).

Column Ids

*Jgenre: All titles in this list are fiction.  This column just provides “fic” to affirm that genre affiliation.
*firstpub: Because in some cases, the earliest available “complete” edition of a title is a later edition or reprint, I provide the date of original publication cited by Leavis in her list.
*citesel:  “cite” means that this Leavis cited this specific title in her list.  “sel” is reserved for sweeping statements about single writers where no representative title is provided. Leavis cites Rider Haggard, Hall Caine, Marie Corelli, and H.G. Wells (broadly) in her list.  Because she does not single out specific titles, as she does with the other writers, I have added single “representative titles.”  Leavis, for example, merely acknowledges the beginning of their careers with no account of their enormous popularity:  “1886  Rider Haggard, Hall Caine, and Marie Corelli begin” (Leavis 334).  For Wells, Leavis cites 1909:  “Wells becomes popular as a propagandist in fiction (334).
