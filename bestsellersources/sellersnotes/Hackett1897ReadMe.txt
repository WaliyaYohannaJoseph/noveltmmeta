Other notes:

On Paul L. Ford's The Honorable Peter Stirling: "Peter Stirling issued in a small first printing, did not sell well until it was bruited about by a San Francisco bookseller that the chief character was modeled on President Cleveland.  Word-of-mouth advertising brought the sales of the book eventually to 228,000 copies" (Hackett 61).
