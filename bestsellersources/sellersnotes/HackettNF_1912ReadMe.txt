HACKETT 1912 List


Duplicates:  

Column Ids:  Hackettlist notes the year list used; NumInList merely records the number from the top 10.  Not clear from information provided how the rank is sorted.  According to Hackett, the 1895-1912 lists are lists from The Bookman.

Yellow highlighter: indicates publisher that corresponds with one cited in Hackett.

*For the purposes of clarity, I have made a separate top 10 list for nonfiction in keeping with Hackett's format.  Beginning with 1912, Hackett provides a top-10 for fiction list and a separate top-10 list for nonfiction.

---------------
Other notes:
*This is the first year that Publisher's Weekly added nonfiction to the lists.  "Previously fiction and nonfiction had been lumped together, with the result that the list consisted almost entirely of fictionâ€¦Not until the 1920s did nonfiction sales equal those of fiction" (Hackett 77).
