Other notes:
*This is the first year that Publisher's Weekly added nonfiction to the lists.  "Previously fiction and nonfiction had been lumped together, with the result that the list consisted almost entirely of fictionâ€¦Not until the 1920s did nonfiction sales equal those of fiction" (Hackett 77).
