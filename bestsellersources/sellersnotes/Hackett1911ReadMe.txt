Other notes:

*"A total of 305,000 copies [of The Broad Highway] were sold in both original and reprint editions" (Hackett 75).
*Gene Stratton Porter, many of whose books are among the big American best sellers of all time, made her first appearance on these lists with the Harvester" (Hackett 75).
*Other work by Gene Stratton Porter: "Freckles had been published in 1904 but had missed making an annual list largely because its great sale came after it had gone into a 50-cent reprint edition" (Hackett 75).
*"The Winning of Barbara Worth was priced at $1.30 and Queed, a first novel that caught the public fancy, at $1.35--both prices typical of their time" (Hackett 75).
