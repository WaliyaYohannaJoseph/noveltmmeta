Other notes:

*"Nonfiction and war books (both added classifications in this year) showed what the war-minded American public wanted, for most books on this 'general nonfiction' list reflected the emotions and emergencies of wartime America" (Hackett 84).

*Hackett's War Books list centers on subject and provides no other data on numbers.  Most of these texts appear trend toward prose and a mix of letters, autobiography, or biography.
