bestseller sources
==================

This folder contains transcriptions of many different bibliographic sources about bestsellers in fiction.

Publishers' Weekly, after 1900, is aggregated in new_unsworth_bestsellers.csv, so named because the transcription was organized by John Unsworth.

Most of the other lists here were transcribed by Jordan Sellers. His notes about the transcription are in the folder **sellersnotes**.

Clive Bloom's bestseller list is in clivebloombestsellers.csv.

aggregatedbestsellermetadata.csv
--------------------------------

If you want just a list of bestsellers in Hathi, and don't care about which historian originally reported them as a bestseller, this is a list based on the Bookman (Hackett), *Publisher's Weekly* (Unsworth), Leavis, Altick, and I think Mott. It includes HathiTrust volume IDs. 

It also includes a lot of metadata for a negative contrast class of non-bestsellers, but you can weed these out using the **sales** column.

count_bestseller_lists.ipynb
----------------------------

is a Jupyter notebook I have used to organize all these sources into a single count of how many times each author appears on a list.
