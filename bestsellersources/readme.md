bestseller sources
==================

This folder contains transcriptions of many different bibliographic sources about bestsellers in fiction.

Publishers' Weekly, after 1900, is aggregated in new_unsworth_bestsellers.csv, so named because the transcription was organized by John Unsworth.

Most of the other lists here were transcribed by Jordan Sellers. His notes about the transcription are in the folder **sellersnotes**.

Clive Bloom's bestseller list is in clivebloombestsellers.csv.

Work on this project was also done by Kyle R. Johnston, although as it happens I don't think any of the files here were directly produced by him.

count_bestseller_lists.ipynb
----------------------------

is a Jupyter notebook I have used to organize all these sources into a single count of how many times each author appears on a list.
